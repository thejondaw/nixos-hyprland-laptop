## V3.0.0 / 2022-11-14

-   Remove [nix-develop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jamesottaway.nix-develop) because :
    -   The repository seems unmaintained
    -   The features seem redundant with others packed extensions
    -   The features seem not to really work

## V2.0.0 / 2022-05-01

-   Replace [cab404's `direnv`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cab404.vscode-direnv) by [Martin KÃ¼hl's `direnv`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkhl.direnv)
    -   The former is depreciated in favor of the latter.
